# `dedalus-bio`: Dedalus tools for biophysics

Dedalus-bio provides a set of benchmarks and templates for common biophysics simulation tasks.

Eventually it will include

* phase field methods
* active nematics
* viscoelastic stresses
* fluid-solid interactions

using the [Dedalus](http://dedalus-project.org/) framework for partial differential equations.
